        h1.h1 Outsourcing vs&nbsp;In-House product design: Which is&nbsp;Better?
        p Fintech is&nbsp;revolutionizing the app design landscape. The industry&rsquo;s interfaces must create entirely new security standards, market invented needs to&nbsp;new adopters, and reduce complex concepts to&nbsp;the simplest of&nbsp;terms. That turns traditional arguments for outsourcing back to&nbsp;front like an&nbsp;old sweater. An&nbsp;in-house team who can create an&nbsp;onboarding app can&rsquo;t necessarily manage the complexity of&nbsp;the stock investment design process. your staff might be&nbsp;competent enough to&nbsp;design a&nbsp;gamified loyalty app, but they may not manage the rigors of&nbsp;full-service banking. Still, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;single perfect response to&nbsp;the outsourcing/insourcing debate, only layers of&nbsp;complexity.
        h2.h2 The Pros and Cons of In-House Development
        p App design is&nbsp;gruelling work, and it&nbsp;requires people who are eager to&nbsp;grow with you until they become your perfect cultural fit. In-house design is&nbsp;deceptively affordable when you&rsquo;re combing through your finances prior to&nbsp;the first iteration of&nbsp;your interface. Fast forward a&nbsp;few years, though, and the true costs come into focus. The long term expenses of&nbsp;an&nbsp;in-house app are reflected&nbsp;in:
        ul
          li Knowledge and skill gaps, which may require you to&nbsp;scrap and recreate your interface several times before release.
          li The monthly salaries of&nbsp;full-time design teams, which are significantly more expensive over time than the scalable costs of&nbsp;outsourcing.
          li A&nbsp;sloppy design process, which could negate any hope of&nbsp;profits.
        p If&nbsp;your in-house project&rsquo;s scope grows, you&rsquo;ll also need to&nbsp;source new talent, but insourcing isn&rsquo;t without its benefits. It&nbsp;builds on&nbsp;a&nbsp;foundation of&nbsp;loyalty, letting you train your own team members to&nbsp;expert level. Employees have a&nbsp;working knowledge of&nbsp;your corporate culture and give you full control of&nbsp;your project.
        h2.h2 The Benefits can Outweigh the Challenges of&nbsp;Outsourcing
        p A&nbsp;subpar firm may not be&nbsp;invested enough in&nbsp;your interests to&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;controlling voice in&nbsp;the design process. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;highly collaborative process that requires a&nbsp;transparent, passionate firm. Choose a&nbsp;company with dwindling profits, and you run the risk of&nbsp;losing the support of&nbsp;the team who designed your app. However, if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re selective about your choice of&nbsp;contractor and do&nbsp;your due diligence in&nbsp;ensuring they have a&nbsp;solid future, you gain unparalleled expertise. Specialists gain extra knowledge by&nbsp;focusing exclusively on&nbsp;architecture, UX&nbsp;and&nbsp;UI design day after day. They will thus:
        ul
          li Evolve with progress in&nbsp;the app design space, allowing them to&nbsp;adopt new technologies and trends early.
          li Have a&nbsp;complete team, including mobile engineers, graphic designers, and&nbsp;UI specialists.
          li Be&nbsp;flexible enough to&nbsp;let you use a&nbsp;mix-sourced design model.
          li Have done work in&nbsp;the fintech niche before, which will have exposed them to&nbsp;innovative marketing tools such as&nbsp;share/reward models, goal-driven personalization, and tools that humanize your app&rsquo;s UX.
        h2.h2 Mixed Models
        p It&rsquo;s not just fintech apps that are becoming increasingly personalized. Outsourced teams are just as&nbsp;adept at&nbsp;offering a&nbsp;personalized delivery model. Project-based outsourcing lets you leverage your in-house team for projects that suit their talents, leaving you to&nbsp;outsource the rest. You can hire external designers to&nbsp;craft your initial interface, then maintain it&nbsp;in-house. This way, new companies can gain the upper hand without committing to&nbsp;one service delivery model. You can even use an&nbsp;outsourced team to&nbsp;support your existing hires or&nbsp;pay a&nbsp;retainer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;contractor to&nbsp;advise your employees.
        p The design process of&nbsp;a&nbsp;product that hasn&rsquo;t yet hit the market requires long term commitment and a&nbsp;refined understanding of&nbsp;your culture. In-sourcing meets those challenges head-on. However, if&nbsp;your product is&nbsp;an&nbsp;app Goliath rather than a&nbsp;David, the level of&nbsp;expertise you need will probably require you to&nbsp;reach beyond your own stable. Outsourcing will prepare you for post-market conditions and give you information on&nbsp;the competitive landscape that your in-house team isn&rsquo;t exposed enough to&nbsp;know.
        p Think of&nbsp;your outsourced designer as&nbsp;the cartographer of&nbsp;your app development &laquo;map.&raquo; It&nbsp;can zoom all the way out to&nbsp;chart entire continents. In-house teams tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too close to&nbsp;land to&nbsp;offer as&nbsp;much perspective. Shared vision is&nbsp;as&nbsp;much a&nbsp;problem as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;asset. Sometimes, you need a&nbsp;new vision to&nbsp;add nuance to&nbsp;your own, and that&rsquo;s a&nbsp;role that outsourcing excels&nbsp;at.
