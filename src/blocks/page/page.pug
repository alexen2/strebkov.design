		h2.h3 About

		p Despite having two parents and a&nbsp;grandfather who were graphic and product designers, my&nbsp;first job out of&nbsp;University was working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;programmer for a&nbsp;company that made flight recorders.

		p What was I&nbsp;thinking?

		p I&nbsp;was told that my&nbsp;toolbar icons looked a&nbsp;heck of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot better than my&nbsp;code, and I&rsquo;m so&nbsp;glad I&nbsp;listened. I&rsquo;ve been designing ever since, and nowadays my&nbsp;team and&nbsp;I help to&nbsp;build great digital products from scratch and improve on&nbsp;existing ones.

		h2.h3 What I do

		p Along with my&nbsp;team, I&nbsp;help software companies build digital products that make people happy, because happy customers are the best sort to&nbsp;have.

		p We&nbsp;design structured services for you with clear steps, because clear and simple design will bring those customers to&nbsp;your door.

		p We&rsquo;re always up&nbsp;to&nbsp;speed with new technologies that attract a&nbsp;younger audience, and we&nbsp;help them to&nbsp;make decisions that make them want to&nbsp;stay with you. We&nbsp;also help you anticipate what they&rsquo;ll want in&nbsp;future because we&rsquo;re all about helping you attract and retain them.

		h2.h3 Why work with&nbsp;me?

		p <span class="bold">15+&nbsp;years of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;usability and visual interface design.</span> Effective design is&nbsp;my&nbsp;passion. I&nbsp;get involved in&nbsp;everything from rough&nbsp;UX concepts to&nbsp;finished UIs, from development support to&nbsp;building design systems and processes. I&rsquo;m always looking for the best solutions for your business.

		p <span class="bold">Diverse experience in&nbsp;10&nbsp;industries across lots of&nbsp;countries.</span> Including data research firms, investment brokers, online education companies and many more. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed working with folks from the USA, UK, China, Germany, Austria, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta, Latvia, India, Russia, and Ukraine, and I&rsquo;m happy to&nbsp;say they&rsquo;ve all been delighted with the results. I&nbsp;know this because they tell me&nbsp;so&nbsp;and because on&nbsp;average they retain my&nbsp;services for 6&nbsp;years.

		p <span class="bold">Lasting relationships.</span> One client has been coming back to&nbsp;us since 2006, and&nbsp;I put this longevity down to&nbsp;our boutique approach. I&rsquo;m the Art Director and Manager on&nbsp;every project, which means that as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;designing up&nbsp;a&nbsp;storm&nbsp;I use my&nbsp;tried and tested methods to&nbsp;keep all those plates spinning at&nbsp;once, so&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll never need to&nbsp;micromanage our work.

		p This means your development team will get exactly what they need, including high-quality layouts in&nbsp;Sketch/Zeplin, clear text instructions, development support and regular UX/UI reviews. And on&nbsp;the practical side, we&rsquo;ve established 2&nbsp;legal entities in&nbsp;different countries to&nbsp;ensure that dealing with&nbsp;us is&nbsp;a&nbsp;breeze.

		h2.h3 How to&nbsp;start working with&nbsp;me

		p Send me&nbsp;an&nbsp;email at&nbsp;<a class="link-bg" href="mailto:&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#107;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;">tim@timstrebkov.com</a> or&nbsp;leave your email address in&nbsp;the form at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;this page. I&rsquo;ll get back to&nbsp;you with additional materials and a&nbsp;project questionnaire so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;can get started.

		h2.h3 How much does it&nbsp;cost?

		p Take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href="plans.html" class="link-bg">pricing page</a> to&nbsp;find the package that best suits your needs. Over the years I&rsquo;ve found that the retainer model works best for pricing, but if&nbsp;you&rsquo;d prefer a&nbsp;fixed price per-project estimate or&nbsp;a&nbsp;customized retainer quote, drop me&nbsp;a&nbsp;line at&nbsp;<a class="link-bg" href="mailto:&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#107;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;">tim@timstrebkov.com</a> and I&rsquo;ll get back to&nbsp;you as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can.
