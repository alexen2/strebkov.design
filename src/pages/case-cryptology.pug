							h2.h2 The Opportunity
							p The client, a&nbsp;Singapore-based fintech company approached&nbsp;us to&nbsp;help them launch an&nbsp;MVP of&nbsp;the cryptocurrency exchange with margin trading capabilities. This was back in&nbsp;October 2017, 2&nbsp;months prior to&nbsp;Bitcoin reaching $17,000.
							p The product was supposed to&nbsp;solve 2&nbsp;key tasks:
							ul
								li Provide non-professional investors an&nbsp;easy on-the-go entry to&nbsp;the crypto market, basically allowing them to&nbsp;convert their fiat money to&nbsp;most popular cryptocurrencies and vice versa, store it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the site, and easily deposit/withdraw to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bank account or&nbsp;a&nbsp;credit card.
								li Introduce them to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;CFD trading, making it&nbsp;as&nbsp;uncomplicated as&nbsp;possible for people with little or&nbsp;no&nbsp;trading experience.

							h2.h2 Our Approach
							p During our work, we&nbsp;followed our proven process for designing an&nbsp;MVP. The discovery stage was really a&nbsp;breeze as&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve been designing trading platforms for multiple clients for years and had lots of&nbsp;experience in&nbsp;the field. After the initial market research, we&nbsp;also had a&nbsp;kick-off brainstorming session in&nbsp;the client&rsquo;s office.
							p One of&nbsp;the key findings for&nbsp;us was that the potential target user might struggle with understanding even some very basic concepts of&nbsp;trading, like stop-loss orders or&nbsp;leverage. This brought&nbsp;us to&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;simplifying them to&nbsp;really basic concepts.
							p The next stage was creating user flows and information architecture, followed by&nbsp;creating the first set of&nbsp;low fidelity wireframes. The visual style of&nbsp;the app was basically dictated by&nbsp;the client&rsquo;s corporate identity&nbsp;&mdash; black and dark grey fills with bright yellow accents. After experimenting with the style on&nbsp;several key screens we&nbsp;applied it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the wireframes and finalized user scenarios and micro-interactions.
							p After about one month since we&nbsp;started our work, we&nbsp;began to&nbsp;actively collaborate with the development team, preparing the assets and making design adjustments along with designing the new functionality.

							h2.h2 The Outcome
							p With our help, the client was able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;from just an&nbsp;idea to&nbsp;the ready-to-implement designs. The development team was able to&nbsp;start the implementation in&nbsp;just 1&nbsp;month after we&nbsp;started our work. After 2&nbsp;months we&nbsp;passed the concept to&nbsp;the in-house design team and then they had the ball.
